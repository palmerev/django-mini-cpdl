# django-mini-cpdl
A score organizer and mini music reference library focusing on early choral music (like works available on [CPDL.org](http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)).

The initial concept is to have a database of works searchable by composer and/or voicing.
Logged-in users will be able to add entries to the database.
